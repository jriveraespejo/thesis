## General information

### Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Models: _method, estimation procedures, advantages, and applications to educational policy_

The short and long term benefits of effective teaching practices can be found in abundance throughout the academic literature. However, while this supports the perception that teachers are one of the main drivers behind the student achievements, the evidence backing such claims has suffered from two main problems: (i) they used proxy variables, which more often than not, were not consistently related to the quality of instruction, and (ii) they used methods that were not concerned in outlining the teaching factors responsible for the student's learning. Nevertheless, while the literature still reflects considerable uncertainty on what are the "ingredients for a good teacher", a good amount of evidence has supported the disciplinary and pedagogical knowledge as relevant components of the teacher effectiveness. Furthermore, the literature has also shown that valid and reliable standardized tests are among the best tools to assess such factors. 

In the face of the previous evidence, this research will have two main goals. First, to describe the method, estimation procedures, and advantages of the Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Modeling framework (GLLAMM), developed by Rabe-Hesketh et al. [49, 51], Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh [62], Rabe-Hesketh et al. [52]. And second, tests the policy implications of the method, and its results, in a data composed of large repeated Teacher’s standardized educational assessments from Peru.

Given the aforementioned goals, the researcher believes the master's thesis contributes to the literature in two aspects:

1. In a the theoretical and methodological sense, as the research is focused on offering an exhaustive description and analysis of the GLLAMM framework; and
2. In a more practical sense, as it helps to provide evidence on some of key policy decisions that most of Latin America countries are currently facing.


### Organization
* **_Chapter 2, The Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Model_**, will describe the model, its components, characteristics, assumptions and properties. Finally, the chapter will assess the benefits of the GLLAMM framework against latent factor, structural equation, item-response theory and multilevel models.
* **_Chapter 3, Bayesian estimation_**, will describe the bayesian framework, its computational implementation, benefits and main shortcomings, in the context of the model.
* **_Chapter 4, Application_**, will describe the instruments, its data collection process, and the "dimensions" under analysis. Finally, the the chapter will showcase: (i) the educational theoretical models considered under the analysis, (ii) the sample design used for obtaining the results, (iii) the priors proposals and their inherited assumptions, and (iv) the results of the analysis.
* **_Chapter 5, Conclusions_**, will discuss the conclusion for the research, under the aforementioned framework, and the policy implications derived from its implementation in a large teacher’s assessment process. Finally, it will outline the path of future research that can be derived from the present effort.


### Technology
The computational implementation of the method will be developed in Stan [65] and R [46, 64].

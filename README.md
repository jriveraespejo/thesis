## General information

### Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Models: _method, estimation procedures, advantages, and applications to educational policy_

The short and long term benefits of effective teaching practices can be found in abundance throughout the academic literature. However, while this supports the perception that teachers are one of the main drivers behind the student achievements, the evidence backing such claims has suffered from two main problems: (i) they used proxy variables, which more often than not, were not consistently related to the quality of instruction, and (ii) they used methods that were not concerned in outlining the teaching factors responsible for the student's learning. Nevertheless, while the literature still reflects considerable uncertainty on what are the "ingredients for a good teacher", a good amount of evidence has supported the disciplinary and pedagogical knowledge as relevant components of the teacher effectiveness. Furthermore, the literature has also shown that valid and reliable standardized tests are among the best tools to assess such factors. 

Considering the previous evidence, this research will have two main goals. First, to describe the method, estimation procedures, and advantages of the Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Modeling framework (GLLAMM) developed by Rabe-Hesketh et al. (2004a,c); Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh (2004a); and Rabe-Hesketh et al. (2012). Specifically, the researcher will appraise if the framework could serve multiple psychometric purposes; and how is related to the known factor, item-response theory and multilevel models. Second, tests the policy implications of the method, and its results, in a data composed of large repeated Teacher's standardized educational assessments from Peru. Specifically, the researcher want to shed some lights about some key policy decisions related to such large evaluation processes, for example, if the educational authorities are screening the teachers with higher disciplinary knowledge?, or what are the general characteristics of the teaching-career applicants?, among a few. 

Given the aforementioned goals, the researcher believes the master's thesis contributes to the literature in two aspects:
* In a the theoretical and methodological sense, as the research is focused on offering an exhaustive description and analysis of the GLLAMM framework; and 
* In a more practical sense, as it provides evidence on some of key educational policy decisions that most of Latin America countries are currently facing.


### Organization
* _Chapter 2, The Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Model_, will describe the model, its components, characteristics, assumptions and properties, to finally assess its benefits against factor (EFA and CFA), IRT and Multilevel models.
* _Chapter 3, Estimation_, will describe two of the methods that can be used to fit such models: Likelihood and Bayesian methods. The chapter will also present the computational implementation of the model.
* _Chapter 4, Application_, will describe the instruments and the ”dimensions” under analysis. Additionally, it will describe briefly the data collection process, the sample design, and the results of the analysis under the GLLAMM framework.
* _Chapter 5, Conclusions_, will discuss the conclusion for the research, in term of the method and the policy implications derived from its implementation in a large teacher's assessment process. Finally, it will outline the path of future research that can be derived from the present effort.


### Technology
The computational implementation of the method will be developed in R (R Core Team; 2015) and WinBUGS (Lunn et al.; 2000).

## Title
**Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Models:**
**_method, estimation procedures, advantages, and applications to educational policy_**


### Preliminary abstract

The short and long term benefits of effective teaching practices can be found in abundance throughout the academic literature. However, while this supports the perception that teachers are one of the main drivers behind the student achievements, the evidence backing such claims has suffered from two main problems: (i) they used proxy variables, which more often than not, were not consistently related to the quality of instruction, and (ii) they used methods that were not concerned in outlining the teaching factors responsible for the student's learning. Nevertheless, while the literature still reflects considerable uncertainty on what are the "ingredients for a good teacher", a good amount of evidence has supported the disciplinary and pedagogical knowledge as relevant components of the teacher effectiveness. Furthermore, the literature has also shown that valid and reliable standardized tests are among the best tools to assess such factors. 

In that sense, this research will have two main goals. First, to describe the method, estimation procedures, and advantages of the Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Modeling framework (GLLAMM) developed by Rabe-Hesketh et al. (2004a,c); Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh
(2004a); Rabe-Hesketh et al. (2012). Second, tests the policy implications of the methods, and its results, in a data composed of large repeated Teacher's standardized educational assessments from Peru.

Specifically, for the first objective of the research, the author expects to appraise:
* If the method can provide a general framework that could serve multiple psychometric purposes, e.g. to analyze the quality of the items, to obtain a dynamical noise-free "score" for the disciplinary abilities of the teachers, among others; and
* What are the advantages or disadvantages of such models, specially compared to factor, item-response theory and multilevel models.

For the second objective, the author expects to shed some lights about some key policy decisions related to those large evaluation processes, to mention a few:
* Are the educational authorities screening the teachers with higher disciplinary knowledge?, and in that sense, what differentiate a contract teacher from a temporary one?,
* What are the general characteristics of the teaching-career applicants?, What is the level of their disciplinary knowledge, and how it evolves?,
* Do the initial training or socioeconomic status help to explain the disciplinary knowledge profile of the applicants?
* What specific factor of the disciplinary knowledge is consistently related to a good performance in the classroom?
* Do the instruments guarantee a fair assessment of minority groups with different abilities?

Given the aforementioned goals, the researcher believes the master's thesis contributes to the literature in two aspects:
* In a the theoretical and methodological sense, as the research is focused on offering an exhaustive description and analysis of the GLLAMM framework; and 
* In a more practical sense, as it helps to provide evidence on some of key policy decisions that most of Latin America countries are currently facing.

## Preliminary organization
* **_Chapter 2, The Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Model_**, will describe the model, its components, characteristics, assumptions and properties, to finally assess its benefits against factor (EFA and CFA), IRT and Multilevel models.
* **_Chapter 3, Estimation_**, will describe two of the methods that can be used to fit such models: Likelihood and Bayesian methods. The chapter will also present the computational implementation of the model.
* **_Chapter 4, Application_**, will describe the instruments and the ”dimensions” under analysis. Additionally, it will describe briefly the data collection process, the sample design, and the results of the analysis under the GLLAMM framework.
* **_Chapter 5, Conclusions_**, will discuss the conclusion for the research, in term of the method and the policy implications derived from its implementation in a large teacher's assessment process. Finally, it will outline the path of future research that can be derived from the present effort.


## Preliminary technology
The computational implementation of the method will be developed in R (R Core Team; 2015) and WinBUGS (Lunn et al.; 2000).


## Status
The status of the project is: **_in progress_**

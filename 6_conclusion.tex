\section{Discussion}

\section{Conclusions}

lack of correlation evidence could be due to the scale setting
besides the models are more based on scientific knowledge rather that data motivated.

\section{Future development}

Investigate this, maybe you need to use Variational Inference methods

It is important to point out, the result did not extend to the sub-dimensions' correlation parameters, where no large difference was observed between the CP and NCP. On this matter, the issue was not related to a lack of identification of said parameters, as we were careful of ensuring this requirement.

CP versus NCP is a false dichotmy, because as authors mentioned they work more in a complementary way, therefore methods that seeks they integrations may need to be the staple of IRT models.

Because of the setting of our simulation experiment, we cannot fully disentangle the benefits of HMC (through adapt delta), the mildly regularizing priors and the CP vs NCP. future developments could assess and compare each of this conditions separately. For example, investigate the recovery capacity under HMC and Gibbs sampling, under CP and NCP with no regularizing priors or adapt delta. as the results could be due to the HMC or the regularizing priors, and we cannot observe the true benefits of the change to NCP.

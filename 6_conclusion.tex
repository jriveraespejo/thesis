Investigate this, maybe you need to use Variational Inference methods

It is important to point out, the result did not extend to the sub-dimensions' correlation parameters, where no large difference was observed between the CP and NCP. On this matter, the issue was not related to a lack of identification of said parameters, as we were careful of ensuring this requirement.


Investigate the recovery capacity under HMC and Gibbs sampling, under CP and NCP. as the results could be due to the HMC or the regularizing priors, and we cannot observe the true benefits of the change to NCP.
